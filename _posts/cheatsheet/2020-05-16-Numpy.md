<br>
To start using numpy, we 
```import numpy as np```
<br>
### 1. Basic Operations
* check the dimensions: ```array.ndim```
* check the shape: ```array.shape```
* check the total number of elements in array: ```array.size```

<br>
### 2. Array type
* Create array from list: ```np.array(any_dimension_list, dtype=np.int32)```
    * dtype is the dat atype of the elements in array
    * ```np.int32``` is the default data type
    * Refer more numpy types [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.types.html)
* Create an array of zeros: ```np.zeros((shape), dtype=atype)```
* Create an array of ones: ```np.ones((3,4))```
* Create an empty array: ```np.empty((shape))```
* Change an array shape to a specified array: ```arr.reshape((shape))```
* Create a series: ```np.arange(start, end+1, step)```
    * e.g. ```np.arange(0,11,2)``` => ```[0,2,4,6,8,10]```
    * np.arange(n) => start from 0 to n, increment by 1 for each step
    * np.arange(end,start-1, -1) , decrease by 1 from end to start
* Create a range of data: ```np.linespace(start_range, end_range, num_items_in_between)
    * e.g. ```np.linespace(1,10,20)``` => [ 1  1.47368421  1.94736842  2.42105263  2.89473684  3.36842105
  3.84210526  4.31578947  4.78947368  5.26315789  5.73684211  6.21052632
  6.68421053  7.15789474  7.63157895  8.10526316  8.57894737  9.05263158
  9.52631579 10.        ]
* Create an array by repeating an array: ```np.title(starting_array, (x,y)```
    * copy the starting_array x rows and y columns
    * i.e. ```np.title([0,1],(3,2))``` resulting in ```[[0,1,0,1],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,0,1]```

### Computation 
~~~ python
a = np.array([10,20,30,40]) # [10,20,30,40]
b = np.arange(4) # [0,1,2,3]
~~~

* ```a-b```, ```a+b```, ```a * b ``` (0,20,60,120)
* ``` a ** n ``` each element in a to power of n
* ```np.sin(a)```, sin(x) for x in a
* ``` b < 2 ``` => [True, True, False, False]
* ``` a==b ``` element wise check of if a==b => [False, False False, False]

* Matrix dot product: ```a.dot(b)``` or ```np.dot(a,b)```
* Minimum and maximum: ```min(a)```, ```max(a)```
* Axis: 
    * 0: find/sum according to each column
    * 1: find/sum according to each row
* Sum of each column: 
    * | 0 | 0 | 0 |
        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
    * ```np.sum(arr, axis=1)``` => [0,1]
    * ```np.sum(arr, axis=0)``` => [1,1,1]
* Get the index of the largest/smallest element in a Matrix A: ```np.argmax(A)```, ```np.argmin(A)```
* Mean of the whole matrix: ```np.mean(A)``` or ```np.average(A)```
* Median: ```np.median(A)```
* Cumulative sum of elements in A: ```np.cumsum(A)```
    * i.e. A = [1,2,3,4] => np.cumsum(A) = [1,3,6,10]
* Difference between 2 consecutive elements: ```np.diff(B)```
    * B = [[1,2,5],[6,8,9]], diff(B)=> [[1,3],[2,1]]
* Get index of nonzero element in an array: ```np.nonzero(A)```
    * A = [[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]]
    * Returns (array([0, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]))
    * which means position(0,0),(1,1), (2,0),(2,1) contains nonzero elements
    * Further usage: A[np.nonzero(A)] => array([3,4,5,6]). However, A[A != 0] is prefered
* Sort each row in ascending order: np.sort(A)
* Transpose: np.transpose(A) or A.T
* Change every element outside a range to the boundary value ```np.clip(A, min, max)```
    * If the min <= element <= max, then keep the original value
    * If the element > max => max instead
    * If the element < min, => min instead
    
### Index
* ```A[index]```, starts from index 0
* For 2D array: ```A[row_index][col_index]``` or ```A[row_index, col_index]```
* To get a list of rows or columns: ```A[row_start:row_end][col_start:col_end]```
* To get elements at multiple positions: ```A[(0,1,2),(4,5,6)]```. this will get you elements at (0,4),(1,5),(2,6)
* Get elements using mask: mask is actually a bool array which indicates which position you want to get
    * i.e. mask = np.array([1,0,1,0],dtype=np.bool) which means we want some elements at index 0,2 (as they are 1 == True)
    * Given ```a = np.array(['a','b','c','d]), a[mask]``` the resulting array is ```['a','c']```
* Flatten a multidimential array to 1D: ```A.flatten()```

### Merge
* Merge A and B with A on top: ```np.vstack((A,B))```
* Merge A and B with A on left: ```np.hstack((A,B))```
* or ```np.concatenate((A,B),axis=0)``` 0: vertical, 1: horizontal
* Transform to matrix:
    * if an array has a shape: (n,), it means the array is a series, not a matrix. To transform, we need a function ```np.newaxis```
    * Let ```A = [1,1,1]```, ```A[np.newaxis, :]``` changes to ```[[1,1,1]]```. np.newaxis at row index means it creates a new row axis, while `:` means all elements in A
    * Similarly, ```A[:, np.newaxis]``` change it to `[[1]],[1],[1]]`
    
### Slicing
* Equal split - A has a size of multiple of n: ```np.split(A, n, axis=1)``` Cut A to n pieces vertically (similar to row), * Unequal split
* Unequal split - A does not have a size of multiply of n, e.g. 10 ```np.array_split(A,3, axis=1)```
* Others: ```np.vsplit(A,3) == np.split(A,3, axis=0)``` and ```np.hsplit((A,2)) == np.split(A,2,axis=1)```

### Coping and assigning
* Using `=` will let every assigning point to the same object
    * Let `a = [0,1,2,3]`, b=a, c=b then , both b and c == `[0,1,2,3]`
    * ```a[index] = a_number```: set position index of a to a_number
    * Set `a[0]=11` => all a,b,c ==```[11,1,2,3]```
    * `print(c is a)` or `print(b is a)` ==> True
    * ```c[1:3] =[22,33]``` set index 1 and 2 of c to be 22 and 33, then ```print(a) ==> [11,22,33,3]```
* Using `copy()` will get an deep copy, it does not relate to the original array
    *  ```a = [0,1,2,3]``` and let ```b=a.copy()```
    * Set ```a[0] = 11```, b will remain to be ```[0,1,2,3]```

### Broadcast
* When 2 arrays have different shape, and we want to perform basic operations, then broadcasting will happen
    * Let ```a = array([[0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2]), b= array([10,10,10])```
    * `a+b == [[10,10,10,11,11,11,12,12,12]]`
  
### Useful functions:
* ```np.bincount()```: count of frequency of elements which are equal to the index
    * ```x=np.array([1,2,0,1,4,1])``` => ```np.bincount(x) == [1,3,1,0,1]```
    * Interpretation: in x there are one 0, three 1s, zero 3, one 4. 
    * Thus for bincount, element at index 0 is the count of 0, thus 1, element at index 1 is the count of 1, thus 3, etc
    * Since the maximum length of bincount(x) is the biggest element in x, i.e. if x has a biggest element 100, then the length of bincount(x) is 101
    * If we want extend the length by appending 0, simply add ```np.bincount(x, minlength=7) ==> [1,3,1,0,1,0,0]```
* ```np.bincount()``` with weights:
    *  ```x=np.array([1,2,0,1,4,1]), w = [0.3,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.1,-0.9]```
    * Then ```np.bincount(x, weights=w)``` outputs ```[0.7,0,0.5,0,0.1]```
    * Interpretation: 0 is at index 2 of x => w[2] == 0.7, thus weight at index 0 is 0.7
    * 1 is at index 0,3,5 of x, index 0,3,5 of w are  0.3, 0.6,-0.9, sums to 0
    * there is no 3 in x, thus it's weight is 0
